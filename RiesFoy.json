Changelings are regarded with disdain, and she had the unfortunate luck of being placed by her birth mother in a small town filled to bursting with stories of stolen children and evil fey. The pitchforks and torches stopped following her when she crossed into a forest the townsfolk feared but, in her fear, she didn't stop until she could no longer recognise her surroundings. \n\nShe knew that she was still in the forest but things seemed different. The green of the leaves was more vibrant, the sky suddenly a deeper blue, the scent of the earth more intense, the chill in the air seeping through her coat where it hadn't before. The flowers on the ground have a faint glow to them and it's when a dryad by the name of Alderia comes across her after what feels like hours wandering the trees that a young Ries realises she is truly lost.\n\nShe spends her days growing and thriving in the Feywild, befriending the creatures of the forest she originally found herself in, and exploring further out as she grows. Ries finds herself falling in love with the beauty of the landscape and becoming familiar with the rules of the tricky creatures that live here, understanding their nature better than any who had never dwelled here. She is struck by childlike wonder wheresoever she goes and decides that this place, the small home built up in the forest where she is always near to her dryad guardian, is home. The small town of her childhood becomes a distant memort and soon she becomes a part of this plane, and it leaves it's mark on her in return.\n\nIt is one day that she is exploring, chasing playful water sprites along a river that she comes across a beautiful waterfall nestled against a cliff amongst the trees and rocks, hiding the opening to a cave and she finds her curiosity too overwhelming to ignore. Climbing up and through, she finds that the cave leads to yet another forest, but there's something off about the colour of the skies and the scent of the trees. Standing in the clearing, she can no longer hear the gentle thrum of the forest, can't sense the presence of the dryads or even hear them tending to the trees and when she turns to go back, she finds that there is no cave where had exited from. \n\nIn her panic, she runs through the forest, calling to the dryads, the forest nymphs, the sprites, hoping that someone will answer. The only response she receives is silence.\n","otherNotes":"Feymark: Ries has a sweet scent, like that of nectar or honey.\n\n\nFeywild Visitor: Whenever Ries is sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay her a visit.
